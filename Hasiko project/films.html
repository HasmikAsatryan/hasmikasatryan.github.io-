					<p>I was First Assistant Director of Music Video Production called "Khio " (one shot) with Margos Margosian. During pre-production, I broke down the script into a shot by shot storyboard, and worked with the director to determine the shoot order, and how long each scene would take to film. They then drew up the overall shooting schedule (a timetable for the filming period). I prepared the storyboard, hired of locations, props and equipment, and checked the works of other departments. During production, I ensured that everyone was on standby and ready for the director's cue for action. I also was responsible to keep filming on schedule by driving it forward, made frequently announcements and gave directions to coordinate the cast and crew.</p>
